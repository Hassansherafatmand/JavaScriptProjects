Two Useful Extensions for My Project:
    1- Prettier â€“ Code Formatter
    2- Live Server

ESLint:*********************************************************
First after installing thje NPM:

1- npm install eslint --save-dev (Adds ESLint to your project (locally))
    This command downloads and installs ESLint into your project, specifically as a development dependency.
    ðŸ“¦ Breakdown:
    npm install â†’ tells npm to install a package
    eslint â†’ the name of the package you're installing
    --save-dev â†’ marks it as a "dev dependency" in package.json, meaning it's only needed during development (not when your app is running live)

2- npx eslint --init (Starts ESLint setup wizard and creates config file)
    This initializes ESLint in your project â€” it asks a series of questions and then generates a configuration file (like .eslintrc.json) tailored to your preferences.
    ðŸ§  What's npx?
    npx is a tool that runs packages without installing them globally
    In this case, it runs the ESLint initializer wizard

    ðŸ“‹ What does it ask?
    You'll be prompted with questions like
    What type of code are you writing? (e.g. JavaScript modules, React, etc.)
    What style rules do you want? (e.g. Airbnb, Standard, etc.)
    What format for your config file? (JSON, JS, YAML)



âœ… Step 1: Install Node.js (with npm)
    Go to https://nodejs.org

âœ… Step 2: Verify Installation
    node -v
    npm -v

âœ… Step 3: Create a Project Folder (if needed)
    mkdir accordion-project
    cd accordion-project

âœ… Step 4: Initialize Your Project
    npm init -y  (This creates a package.json file so your project can manage packages like ESLint.)

âœ… Step 5: Install ESLint
    npm install eslint --save-dev

âœ… Step 6: Configure ESLint
    npx eslint --init
